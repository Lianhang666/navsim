DiffusionDrive Updates
This repository contains updates and improvements to the DiffusionDrive project, specifically focusing on enhancing diffusion-based driving agents and training/evaluation scripts.
Focus Areas
Our work concentrates on two key components:

Enhanced Diffusion Drive Agents (agents/diffusiondrive/)

Improved diffusion model architecture
Better conditional sampling techniques
Enhanced trajectory prediction accuracy


Optimized Training & Evaluation Scripts (planning/script/)

Streamlined training pipelines
Improved evaluation metrics
Faster and more efficient scripts
